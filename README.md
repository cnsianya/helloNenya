A food engineer from the east of Nigeria switching career paths into tech mainly because unemployed. been jobless is a very heavy job and quite thankless.
By the end of the year, I would have my own house and a car, and be so financiallly free and othher good things of life i want, i will ofcourse be putting in the effort required for this now. 
i love food too. A lot. Don't enjoy them anymore though.
